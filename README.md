# dotfiles using GNU Stow

Here are my dotfiles that I use to configure a basic development environment anywhere.

I utilize GNU Stow to create symlinks to this folder via naming conventions in this repo.

For example, running `stow tmux` will create a symlink in `~/.config/tmux/` to point to `dotfiles/tmux/.config/tmux/`
